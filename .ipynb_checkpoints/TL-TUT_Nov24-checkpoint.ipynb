    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will attempt to benefit from a model that has been pretrained for the same task but on a different dataset. You will deploy the first layers and their feature extraction capabilities of a converged network. This process is known as transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Core idea\n",
    "A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task, such as [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), and [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home). We can either use the pretrained model as it is for inference on the task it has been trained on or we can do transfer learning using the pretrained convents for further training on a new dataset with a possibly new output space. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind transfer learning is that if this model trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world and the semantic features present in the visual world and shared between all visual tasks. We can leverage these learned feature maps without having to train a large model on a large dataset by using these models as the basis of our own model specific to our task. There are 2 scenarios of transfer learning using a pretrained model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine Tuning or Retraining: Unfreezing a few of the top layers of a frozen model base used for feature extraction, and jointly training both the newly added classifier layers as well as the last layers of the frozen model. This allows us to \"fine tune\" the higher order feature representations in addition to our final classifier in order to make them more relevant for the specific task involved.\n",
    "- Feature Extraction: Use the representations learned by a previous model to extract meaningful features from new samples. We simply add a new output layer, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that we can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for our dataset and our new output space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the notions behind retraining and feature extractions in your own words."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "# Explain the notions behind retraining and feature extractions in your own words.\n",
    "- Retraining a pre-trained model, will update the weights of all the layers in the pretrained model corresponding to the features obtained from the new dataset. This will give the model a better validation accurary corresponding to the new dataset. It is useful if the corresponding environments of the dataset used for pre-trained model and the new dataset are not relatively similar. One disadvantage is , it will not tell us how good of a predictor our pre trained model is for the new data.\n",
    "- In Feature extraction , all the weights of the layers in the pre-trained model are frozen. The output layer added (like a classifier) , will just give the predictions of the classes in the new dataset, instead of training all the previous layers. It is useful if the corresponding environments of the dataset used for pre-trained model and the new dataset are relatively similar.The advantage is , it will tell us how good of a predictor our pre trained model is for the new data. The disadvantage is , if the environments are not relatively similar, the validation accuracy might decrease."
